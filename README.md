## *The Digital Closet* Personal Project
### UBC CPSC 210 Term Project
###### Felix Grund (professor) and Arthur Marques (TA)

My term project is called *The Digital Closet*.   

Have you ever wanted to visually create outfits using your own clothes in your closet? Do you 
wake up in the morning scrambling to find the perfect outfit amongst the cesspool you call a closet?<br>

> What will the application do?<br>

Look no further because *The Digital Closet* is the perfect app for you! Recreate your closet simply by
entering some information about each piece of clothing! Give each piece of clothing tags so that you
can easily find them within the app. Create and save your favorite oufits to remove the morning stressors
which will keep you looking beautiful and fashionable. Finally, track what you wore each day and favorite
your best sets.

> Who will use it?<br>

You might be wondering, is this the right application for you? ***OF COURSE IT IS***!!! Teenagers and young 
adults can use this app to constantly look stylish without the daily hassle of **thinking**. All the adults
going through **mid-life crises** can look stylish while contemplating your self-identity and confidence. Even
you seniors can make use of this app. It's never too late to look good. From babies to the casket, this app is
for ***ANYONE***.

> Why is this project of interest to you?<br>

This project was inspired by my laziness and how much I pointlessly stare at things on my phone. Whenever, I procrastinate
on responsibilities such as washing or folding my clothes, I end up procrastinating by playing with a trending app
or watching a YouTube video. I thought, what if I could organize my clothes with my phone! It would be
much more interesting, fun, and it might motivate me to organize my actual clothes after playing around
with the app especially if the app requires interaction and observations of the clothing items. Many others own 
multiple times the amount of clothes and accessories that I own. I can only imagine how hard it is for them to 
build the self-motivation. This app is for all the people who procrastinate on folding clothes but can also
be used by anyone who simply wants to look good without the stress!
